   The purpose of this program is to create a solution to a maze represented by a 2-dimensional array of characters. 
   The algorithim used to solve the maze will rely on using the right hand side of the wall and has four cases.
   The Cases are as follows:
   1. No right side - turn right and walk one block.
   2. No wall forwards - walk one block.
   3. No left side - turn left and walk one.
   4. Else - 180 degrees and walk one.
   The program will first display the unsolved maze.
   Then once the maze has been solved it will display the solution.*/
